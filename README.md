Carbon Aware SDK WebAPI client test for TypeScript
===

This example shows how to use TypeScript NPM module for [Carbon Aware SDK](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk) generated by OpenAPI Generator.

NPM module is provided by [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/YaSuenag/ts-npm-casdk-sandbox/pkgs/npm/casdk). This would be generated by GitHub Actions [workflow](https://github.com/YaSuenag/ts-npm-casdk-sandbox/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-npm-lib.yaml).

Client code is [index.ts](index.ts). This code dumps all of locations in CASDK.

# How to test

## 1. Install dependencies

You have to run `npm install` at first. CASDK client module would be downloaded from GitHub Packages, so you need to set GitHub Parsonal Access Token. You can set it to `GH_TOKEN` environment variable.

If you have not yet got GitHub PAT, see [this guide](https://docs.github.com/ja/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

```
GH_TOKEN=<GitHub PAT> npm install
```

## 2. Run WebAPI

If you want to run WebAPI on container runtime, you can use following command.

```
podman run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/green-software-foundation/carbon-aware-sdk:pre
```

## 3. Run

```
npx ts-node index.ts
```
